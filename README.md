# Text Editor

In this project, I created a full-stack text editor web application. This application also falls under the category of a PWA, or a progressive web application. This is an application that gives users an experience similar to native apps, such as on one's desktop or mobile device.

In order to use this project, you will need to go to the Heroku link, which you can find below. When the user goes to the website, the user can type into the text editor. The text will save, so whenever that user goes back to the text editor, their changes will remain. When the user clicks the Install button, webpage will turn into an application, which will have an icon save on the desktop, along with opening a desktop application. This is what a progressive web application demonstrates.
